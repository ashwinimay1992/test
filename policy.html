</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
	<b>On the basis of our legitimate interest </b>in the effective delivery of our products, services and communications to you as well as to our other customers and partners, in order to:

	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	We will only process any special categories of Personal Data (“Sensitive Personal Data”) relating to you for specific purposes outlined above or in relevant Product Notices, because either: 
<ul>
	<ol>1. You have given us your explicit consent to process that data; or</ol>
	<ol>2. The processing is necessary to carry out our obligations under employment, social
			security or social protection law;</ol> 
	<ol>3. The processing is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal
			claims; or </ol>
	<ol>4. You have made the data public.</ol> 
</ul>
</p>
<p>
	<b>Marketing and Community Networking</b>
	<p>
		ePrompto has a legitimate interest in promoting our commercial offerings and to optimize the delivery of communications to that effect to our customers and audiences that are most likely to find them relevant. We will therefore collect and process data to that end as explained below. However, where we are legally required to obtain your consent to provide you with certain marketing materials, we will only provide you with such marketing materials where we have obtained such consent from you. 
	</p>
</p>
<p><b>Tracking Technologies, Cookies & Do-Not-Track</b></p>
<p>
	<b>Cookies</b>
	<p>A cookie is a commonly used automated data collection tool. Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer or device by websites that you visit or HTML-formatted emails you open, to make websites work, or work more efficiently. We may use cookies, scripts or other similar technologies on our websites or emails to:
		<ul>
			<li>Ensure the proper functioning of our websites and the proper delivery of legitimate electronic communications;</li>
			<li>Tailor information presented to you based on your browsing preferences, such as language and geographical region;</li>
			<li>Collect statistics regarding your website usage;</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
</p>
<p>We use different kinds of cookies:
	<p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Essential cookies</b>are necessary to provide you with services and features available through our websites. Without these cookies, services you may need, cannot</li>
			<li><b>Analytics or customization cookies</b>collect data that is either used in aggregate form to help us understand how the website is being used or how effective our marketing campaigns are, or to help us customize the website for you.</li>
		</ul>
		We gather certain data automatically and store it in log files. This data may include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data. We may combine this log data with other data we collect about you. We do this to
		improve services we offer you, to improve marketing, analytics, or site functionality.
	</p>
</p>
<p>
	<b>Automated Individual Decision-Making and Profiling</b>
	<p>
		Where ePrompto processes network traffic data for the purpose of network and information security based on our or our customers’ legitimate interest as outlined in the corresponding section of this Statement, automated decisions concerning particular data elements may occasionally be made. This could involve in particular assigning relative cybersecurity reputation scores to IP addresses and URLs based on objective cyber-threat indicators measured by our cyber-threat detection engines. Such indicators may be for instance the determination that malicious or otherwise harmful contents are hosted at a given URL, or are emanating from a given IP address. They could therefore result in our products and services blocking network traffic coming from or going to such URLs and IP addresses. No such processing is intended to produce any other effect than protecting you, ePrompto, other customers from cyber-threats. Should you nevertheless consider that such automated processing is unduly affecting you in a significant way, please contact directly the relevant data controller whose use of our products and services is thus impacting you. In case that data controller is ePrompto, please refer to the “Your Privacy Rights” and “Contact Us” sections of this Statement to raise your concerns and to seek our help in finding a satisfactory solution.
	</p>
</p>
<p>
	<b>How We Disclose Your Personal Data</b>
	<p>
		We do not sell, lease, rent or give away your Personal Data. We only disclose your Personal Data as described below, within ePrompto, with service providers that process data on our behalf and with public authorities, as required by applicable law. Processing is only undertaken for the purposes described in this Statement and the relevant product and service privacy notices. If we disclose your Personal Data, we require its recipients to comply with adequate privacy and confidentiality requirements, and security standards.
	</p>
</p>

<p>
	<b>Service Providers Processing Data on Our Behalf</b>
	<p>
		We may use contractors and service providers to process your Personal Data on our behalf for the purposes described in this Statement and the relevant product and service privacy notices accessible below. We contractually require service providers to keep data secure and confidential and we do not allow our data processors to disclose your Personal Data to others without our authorization, or to use it for their own purposes. However, if you have an independent relationship with these service providers their privacy statements will apply to such relationships. Such service providers may include in particular contact centers, payment card processors
		and marketing/survey/analytics suppliers.
	</p>
</p>

<p>
	<b>Public Authorities</b>
	In certain instances, it may be necessary for ePrompto to disclose your Personal Data to public authorities or as otherwise required by applicable law. No Personal Data will be disclosed to any public authority except in response to:
	<ul>
		<li>A subpoena, warrant or other process issued by a court or other public authority of competent jurisdiction;</li>
		<li>A legal process having the same consequence as a court-issued request for data, in that if ePrompto were to refuse to provide such data, it would be in breach of local law, and it or its officers, executives or employees would be subject to liability for failing to honor such legal process;</li>
		<li>
			Where such disclosure is necessary for ePrompto to enforce its legal rights pursuant to applicable law;
		</li>
		<li>
			A request for data with the purpose of identifying and/or preventing credit card fraud; or Where such disclosure of Personal Data is necessary to prevent or lessen a serious and imminent threat of bodily or other significant harm to the data subject or other individuals potentially concerned.
		</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p>
